# Multi camera calibration
This example shows how to calibrate multiple OAK cameras in order to gain more accurate spatial locations of objects.

Place the chessboard in view of all cameras. If neccessary first adjust the chessboard parameters. When all cameras are calibrated, the message 'Calibration is completed.' will be printed. Objects that are detected by more than one camera will be shown on the plot.
